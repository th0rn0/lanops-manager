        A LAN party is a gathering where gamers connect their computers or consoles to a Local Area Network (LAN) to play multiplayer games together in the same physical location. Before high-speed internet made online gaming widespread, LAN parties were the ultimate way to experience fast, lag-free competitive or cooperative gameplay. Players would haul their PCs, monitors, and networking gear to a designated spot—often a friend’s house, a gaming café, or even a large event space—to battle it out in games like Counter-Strike, StarCraft, Halo, or Quake.

        These events range from small casual get-togethers to massive organized tournaments, sometimes lasting all night with energy drinks and snacks fueling the competition. Even in the age of online gaming, LAN parties remain a nostalgic and community-driven experience, bringing gamers together for face-to-face interactions, teamwork, and some good old-fashioned trash talk.
