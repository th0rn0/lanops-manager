        LanOps isn't only an event though, it's also a group of fun loving people. We attend other LAN parties across the country, such as The Frag Factory, Breach LAN, epic.LAN, RetroLAN, and many more. With a vibrant Steam community, discord group and teamspeak server our admins along with many players are online round the clock so you're never going to be short of someone to play games with, or just relax and chat with.
