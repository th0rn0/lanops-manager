        Fast forward to 2008. LanOps holds a LAN at the Sheffield Hallam Arena which proves to be the peak of the initial incarnation and the LanOps went on itâ€™s first Hiatus Reforming in 2010 with a new line up and a new venue, Dronfield Civic Hall eventually moving into Sheffield city centre until the venue we were at shut down, and now in 2016, after more than two dozen LANS, we are better than ever, currently based in North Wingfield just outside of Chesterfield less than 10 minutes from the M1, we are based in a modern venue, faster internet, and great help from our LAN friends, UKVR who do VR experiences and racing rigs and LanCafe who do affordable quality breakfasts and snacks and drinks throughout the event.

        LanOps isn't only an event though, it's also a group of fun loving people. We attend other LAN parties across the country, such as The Frag Factory, Breach LAN, epic.LAN, RetroLAN, and many more. With a vibrant Steam community, discord group and teamspeak server our admins along with many players are online round the clock so you're never going to be short of someone to play games with, or just relax and chat with.
